# What is an Agorex Improvement Proposal (AIP)? #
An AIP is a document providing information to the Agorex community or describing process that the Agorex community follows. The AIP should provide a concise specification of a process and a rationale for it. The AIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.


# Rational #
To encourage and support our goal of providing a public, open, honest, community-run decentralized exchange, we need a well defined process for collecting, discussing, and adopting processes that the Board of Directors executes on behalf of the community.

We intend for AIPs to be the primary mechanisms for the community to propose new processes, raise issues, and collect community input on processes and issues. AIPs serve as the official documentation for the the processes that the Board of Directors executes on behalf of the community. Because the AIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the proposal.


# Proposal Types #
There are three types of proposals:

- An **Informational Proposal** describes an issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational proposals do not necessarily represent community consensus or a recommendation, so community members and users are free to ignore Informational proposals or follow their advice.
- A **Meta Proposal** describes a process surrounding Agorex or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process proposals often require community consensus and unlike Informational Proposals, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Agorex development. Any meta-AIP is also considered a Process AIP.


# Proposal Workflow #
The [@Agorex-io/board-of-directors](https://github.com/orgs/Agorex-io/teams/board-of-directors) change the proposal status.

The Proposal process begins with a new idea for Agorex. It is highly recommended that a single proposal contain a single key proposal or new idea. The more focused the proposal, the more successful it tends to be. The proposal editor reserves the right to reject proposals if they appear too unfocused or too broad. If in doubt, split your proposal into several well-focused ones.

Each proposal must have a **champion** - someone who writes the proposal using the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea.

Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing an proposal is meant to save the potential author time. Asking the community first if an idea is original helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching the Internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Examples of appropriate public forums to gauge interest around your proposal include [the Issues section of this repository](https://github.com/Agorex-io/Proposals/issues), [the Agorex subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Agorex/), and [one of the Agorex Discord chat rooms](https://discord.gg/bEPhszu). In particular, [the Issues section of this repository](https://github.com/Agorex-io/Proposals/issues) is an excellent place to discuss your proposal with the community and start creating more formalized language around your proposal.
